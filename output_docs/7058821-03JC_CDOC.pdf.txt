incomplete	or	lack	key	information	may	be	rejected	by	the	purch asing	agency.		Mandatory

the	RFP.	 If 	a	 response	covers	m ore	than	 one 	page,	 the	paragrap h	number 	and subletter	
should	 be repeated	at	 the	 top	 of the 	next	 page.	 	The proposal	 should	contain a	table	of
contents,	which	cross‐references	t he	 RFP	requirements.		 Information 	which	the offeror
desires	to	present	that	does	not 	fall	within	any	of	the	require ments	of 	the 	RFP	should	be

revisions	to the	RFP will	be 	made	 only	 by	Addendum 	issued	by	 the	Services	 Category Manager.	 
J. PAYMENT:		 
1. To	Prime 	Contractor:	 
a) Invoices for items 	ordered, 	delivered and	 accepted	 shall	 be	 submitted by	 the	 Contractor	
directly	 to	 the	 payment address	 shown	 on the	 purchase	 order/Con tract.	 All	 invoices	
shall	 show the	 VCU Contract	 number	 and/or purchase	 order	 number;	 social	 security 
number	 (for	 individual	 Contractors)	 or	 the	 federal	 employer	 identification	 number	 (for	
proprietorships,	partnerships,	and	corporations).		 
b) Any	 payment	 terms	 requiring payment in less 	than 	thirty (30) 	days will 	be 	regarded as
requiring	 payment	 thirty	 (30)	 days	 after	 invoice	 or	 delivery,	 whichever	 occurs	 last.	 This	
shall	not	affect	offers	of	discounts	for payment	in	less	than	thirty	(30)	days,	however.		 
c) All	 goods	 or	 services	 provided	 under	 this	 Contract	 or	 purchase	 order,	 that	 are	 to	 be	 paid	
for	 with	 public	 funds,	 shall	 be	 billed	 by	 the	 Contractor	 at	 the contract	 price,	 regardless
of	which 	public	institution	is	being	billed.		 
d) The following 	shall 	be 	deemed 	to 	be 	the 	date of payment: 	the 	date	 of	 postmark	 in	 all	 
cases	 where payment	 is made	 by	 mail,	 or	 the	 date	 of	 offset when offset proceedings
have	been	instituted	as	authorized	under	the	Virginia	Debt	Coll ection	Act.		 
e) Unreasonable Charges.	 Under	 certain emergency	 procurements	 and	 for	 most	 time	 and
material	 purchases,	 final	 job	 costs	 cannot	 be	 accurately	 determined	 at	 the	 time	 orders
are placed.	 In 	such cases,	contractors	should	be	put	on 	notice	 that 	final	payment 	in full	is 
contingent on	 a	 determination of reasonableness	 with	 respect	 to all	 invoiced	 charges.
Charges	 which	 appear to be unreasonable will be	 researched and	 challenged,	 and that	
portion	 of	 the	 invoice held	 in abeyance	 until	 a	 settlement	 can	 be	 reached.	 Upon
determining	 that	 invoiced	 charges	 are	 not	 reasonable,	 VCU	 shall promptly	 notify	 the
contractor,	 in writing,	 as to	 those	 charges which	 it considers	 unreasonable 	and 	the 	basis
for	 the	 determination.	 A Contractor	 may	 not institute	 legal	 action	 unless	 a	 settlement	
cannot	 be	 reached	 within thirty	 (30)	 days	 of	 notification.	 The provisions	 of	 this	 Section 
do 	not 	relieve 	VCU of its prompt 	payment obligations with 	respect	 to	 those	 charges	 that 
are	not	in 	dispute	(Code of	 Virginia,	§	 2.2‐4363).		 
f) To	 Subcontractors: 
a) Contractor	awarded	a	contract	under	this	RFP	is	 hereby 	obligated:		 
i. To 	pay 	the 	Subcontractor(s) within 	seven (7) 	days of 	the 	Contractor's 	receipt of
payment from 	VCU for 	the 	proportionate 	share of 	the 	payment 	received	 for 
work	performed	by	the	Subcontract or(s)	under	the	contract;	or		 
ii. To notify	 VCU	 and	 the	 Subcontractor(s),	 in	 writing,	 of	 the	 Contractor's	 intention	
to	withhold	 payment 	and 	the	reason. 
b) The	 Contractor	 is	 obligated	 to	 pay	 the	 Subcontractor(s)	 interest 	at 	the 	rate of 	one 
percent	 per	 month	 (unless	 otherwise	 provided	 under	 the	 terms	 of 	the 	contract) 	on all
amounts	 owed	 by	 the	 Contractor	 that remain unpaid	 seven	 (7)	 days	 following	 receipt 
of 	payment from VCU, 	except for 	amounts withheld 	as 	stated in 	2.	 above.	 The date of 
mailing of 	any 	payment by 	U.S. 	Mail is 	deemed 	to 	be 	payment 	to the	 addressee.	 These

	provisions	 apply	 to	 each	 sub‐tier	 Contractor	 performing	 under the	 primary	 contract.	 A	
Contractor's	 obligation	 to	 pay	 an	 interest	 charge	 to a Subcontr actor	 may	 not	 be	 
construed	to be	an 	obligation	of VCU.		 
K. PRECEDENCE OF TERMS: Paragraphs A‐J of these General Terms	 and Conditions	 shall apply	 in	 all	 
instances.	 In the	 event	 there	 is	 a conflict	 between	 any	 of the other	 General	 Terms	 and	 Conditions

the	 Offeror	 shall	 furnish	 to	 VCU	 all	 such information	 and	 data	 for 	this 	purpose 	as may 	be 	requested. 
VCU 	reserves 	the right 	to inspect	 Offeror's	 physical	 facilities prior 	to 	award 	to 	satisfy 	questions
regarding	 the	 Offeror's capabilities.	 VCU	 further reserves	 the	 right to	 reject	 any	 Proposal	 if	 the
evidence 	submitted by, or investigations of, 	such Offeror fails to	 satisfy	 VCU	 that	 such	 Offeror	 is 
properly 	qualified 	to 	carry 	out 	the obligations of 	the 	Contract and	 to provide	 the	 services	 and/or	 
furnish	the	goods	contemplated	therein.		 
M. TESTING	 AND	 INSPECTION:	 VCU	 reserves	 the	 right	 to	 conduct	 any	 test/inspection	 it	 may	 deem
advisable	to	assure	goods and	services 	conform	to 	the	specifica tions.

compensation	shall	be	determined by	one	of	the	following	method s:		 
a) By	mutual agreement	 between 	the	parties	in	writing; or	 
b) By 	agreeing upon a 	unit price 	or 	using a 	unit 	price 	set forth in the	 Contract,	 if	 the	 work
to	 be	 done	 can	 be	 expressed	 in	 units,	 and	 the	 Contractor	 accounts for 	the 	number of 
units of 	work 	performed, 	subject 	to 	the 	VCU’s right 	to 	audit 	the	 Contractor's	 records

c) By	 ordering	 the	 Contractor	 to proceed	 with the	 work	 and	 keep a record of	 all	 costs

the	 Commonwealth	 of	 Virginia’s	 Purchasing	 Manual	 for	 Institutio ns of Higher 	Education

for 
Clarification 
Submitted 
By 
Potential 
Offerers 
for 
RFP# 
6946149JC The 
questions 
submitted 
by 
potential 
proposers 
and 
the 
answers 
from 
VCU 
are 
below. The 
clarifications 
are 
in 
bold 
and 
italics. 1. 
Is 
it acceptable 
to 
exclude 
pricing 
for 
any 
manufacturers 
that 
do 
not 
offer products 
within 
our 
chosen 
categories? It 
is 
a 
business 
decision 
whether 
your 
firm 
wants 
to 
propose 
to 
only 
sell "chosen" 
categories 
and 
manufacturers. 2. 
Can 
you 
provide 
any 
insight 
into 
the 
type 
of 
AN 
gear 
needed 
for 
this 
RFP? 
We carry 
a 
range 
of 
products 
and 
I am 
curious 
if you 
all 
are 
interested 
in 
more Commercial 
AudioffV's/Home 
style 
components. Please 
see 
Section 
VI, 
Item 
B.2.a 
on 
Page 
11 
of 
the 
RFP 
for 
a 
list 
of 
the largest 
volume 
manufacturers. 3. 
Since 
we 
are 
a 
local 
business 
(based 
in 
Charlottesville), 
would 
it help 
if we 
could physically 
swap 
out 
any 
defective 
gear 
within 
a 
short 
period 
of 
time 
(1 
day)? The 
VASCUPP 
AV 
contracts 
are 
used 
by 
institutions 
of 
higher 
education and 
localities 
throughout 
the 
Commonwealth 
of 
Virginia. 
It 
is 
a 
business decision 
what 
your 
company 
wants 
to 
propose 
about 
swapping 
out defective 
gear. 4. 
I see 
in 
the 
RFP 
that 
"installation 
services 
are 
required 
for 
approximately 
90% 
of the 
VCU 
AV 
projects" 
and 
that 
bidders 
"must 
have 
a 
Class 
"A" 
Contractor's License"; 
would 
you 
be 
willing 
to 
accept 
proposals 
from 
vendors 
without 
a 
Class A 
license 
offering 
products 
for 
projects 
that 
do 
not 
require 
installation 
services? The 
contractor 
must 
have 
a 
Class 
A 
Virginia 
Contractor's 
License. 
Having a 
Class 
A 
Contractor's 
License 
is 
a 
mandatory 
requirement 
of 
the RFP. 
Companies 
that 
do 
not 
have 
a 
Class 
A 
Contractor's 
License 
are 
non­responsive 
and 
not 
eligible 
for 
an 
award 
from 
the 
RFP. 5. 
We 
do 
not 
hold 
a 
Class 
"A" 
contractor's 
license. 
We 
hold 
a 
Class 
"B." 
Section 
e. states you 
must 
include 
"a 
copy 
of 
your 
firm's 
Class 
"A" 
Contractor's 
License 
with appropriate 
specialty 
classification 
as 
recognized 
by 
the 
Virginia 
Board 
for Contractors, 
Department 
of 
Professional 
and 
Occupational 
Regulation 
to 
perform the 
AV 
installation 
services." 
Section 
H. 
Contractor 
Registration 
states 
that 
either Class 
"A" 
or 
Class 
"B" 
is 
acceptable. 
Can 
you 
please 
clarify 
what 
is 
required? Section 
H. 
does 
not 
state 
that either 
Class 
"A" 
or 
Class 
"B" 
is 
acceptable. Please 
see 
the 
answer 
to 
question 
#4 
above. 6. 
Our 
company 
is 
undergoing 
SWaM 
recertification. 
How 
will 
our 
pending 
re­certification 
impact 
our 
evaluation? The 
SWaM's 
numerical 
score 
is 
for 
DSBSD 
registered 
firms 
only. 
If 
a 
firm is 
in 
the 
process 
of
completing 
the 
registration, 
the 
points 
are 
only 
added to 
the 
total 
score 
after 
the 
registration 
is 
complete 
prior 
to 
the 
contract award. 
The 
points 
are 
not 
retroactive 
and 
are 
only 
added 
at 
the 
next milestone 
scoring 
during 
the 
RFP 
evaluation 
for 
firms 
that 
are 
still 
under consideration 
for 
the 
contract 
award. 7.

and

Can 
you 
please 
tell 
me 
what 
proprietary 
information 
means? Proprietary 
information 
is 
confidential 
information 
that 
could 
be 
referred 
to as 
a 
trade 
secret. 
It 
is 
information 
that 
would 
put 
your 
organization 
at 
a competitive 
disadvantage 
if 
the 
information 
became 
generally 
known 
in 
the marketplace. 8. 
We 
are 
a 
small, 
minority 
business 
located 
in 
Maryland, 
and 
I was 
just 
wondering if 
we 
have 
to 
be 
located 
in 
VA 
to 
qualify 
for 
this. 
Any 
assistance 
you 
can 
provide would 
be 
greatly 
appreciated. Your 
company 
does 
not 
have 
to 
be 
located 
in 
Virginia, 
but 
a 
small, 
minority business 
must 
be 
certified 
by 
DSBSD 
as 
a 
small, 
minority 
business 
to 
be recognized 
as 
a 
SWaM's 
business 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
the 
RFP. 9. 
Can 
I submit 
a 
proposal 
for 
VASCUPP 
inclusion 
for 
AV 
rental 
and 
labor 
services only 
as 
I am 
no 
longer 
a

of

specified 
in 
the 
Statement 
of 
Needs, 
the 
core 
requirement 
for 
RFP # 
7058821JC 
is 
the 
purchase 
of
AV 
equipment 
and 
the 
installation/support for 
that 
equipment. 
It 
is

d. Provide plans to provide the equipment and services specified in Section V.B 
Avitecture’s approach to the system design process has four very distin ct phases. Each phase is intended 
to satisfy requirements for the entire project team and to maximize the efficiency of the design process.  
PHASE I. SCHEMATIC DESIGN 
This first phase entails listening to the owner’s functi onal requirements (both current and wish list) for the 
space in general terms and creating a schematic design that meets the owner’s needs and budget. Benefits 
and liabilities of any proposed solutions are identified and explained in clear language, so the owner can 
make an informed decision on potentially comple x, technical systems based on known facts from 
Avitecture’s extensive and hard-won knowledge base. 
The specific requirements of the facility on an area-b y-area basis are identified as well. This will be 
accomplished through weekly project mee tings with the client’s technical  representatives to map out the 
various areas and establish the requirements for each w ith regards to system ca pabilities, performance and 
growth potential. The purpose of this design phase is to determine the audiovisual systems design intent, 
create a thorough budgetary analysis, and ensure that the proper design direction is being followed. The deliverables during this phase typically include: 
Design Concept Narrative 
The first step in the design process is determini ng the final experience intended in a written concept 
narrative. 
Cost Estimate and Proposed Equipment List 
The Cost Estimate is developed very early in th e process, and used as a guideline when making 
design decisions. The estimate is based on an evol ving equipment list. Avitecture adjusts the design 
based on this cost estimate and the desired budget. 
Preliminary Cut Sheet Binder 
Avitecture maintains a binder with product specification literature, such as cut sheets, for all products 
included in the design. We encourage the client to be  aware of the products that will be used and learn 
about them.

d. Provide plans to provide the equipmen t and services specified in Section V.B – 
continued 
PHASE 2. D ESIGN DEVELOPMENT 
Once the design direction has been clearly defined, we can finalize the facility impact information and 
proceed into a fully developed design. The deliverable s of the first phase are all included in the Design 
Development deliverable and are updated to include any design revisions. Schema tic drawings indicating 
system components and their connectivity are added, as  well as a variety of other detailed drawings listed 
below. When Design Development is complete, we provide a cost breakdown for the equipment and 
installation. 
The deliverables during this phase typically include: 
Single Line Flow Diagrams Audio, video and control systems are all illustrated graphically to indicate their interconnectivity and 
signal flow. Devices are marked with manufact urer, model number, and unique identifiers. 
Rack Elevations Audio, video and control system equipment racks are drawn to scale, indicating the locations of 
equipment and circuiting requirements. Devi ce identifiers are indicated on all devices. 
Patch Bay Elevations Patch points are indicated on signal flow diagrams, but the front elev ations and labeling of the patch 
bays are illustrated on Patch Bay Elevation drawings. 
Custom Panel Designs 
All custom manufactured audio and video panels th roughout the facility are illustrated to scale with 
connector types, labels, and part numbers for butt ons and connectors. These details also include the 
layout for cross-connect panels in the facility. This information is provided to facilitate the location of 
conduit entry points in the boxes. 
Control Panel Layouts 
Layouts of all control panels will be provided to the client for review and will show all control 
functions, button locations, and labeling. Any change s will be incorporated in the final design. 
Speaker Mounting Details Typical mounts for all speakers are illustrated, as well as unique, custom mounting systems used for 
speaker clusters.

Projector, Display and Screen Mounting Details and Geometry 
Mounting hardware, locations and attachment points for projectors are illustrated on facility plan and 
section view drawings. The projection path, which must be clear of obstruction, will be clearly 
indicated, so that the client’s architects and engine ers can evaluate these requirements and ensure that 
all planned projection systems are suitable. 
Grounding Detail 
This is a standard drawing that indicates the method of providing power and grounding to the 
audiovisual system. In general, a separate Tec hnical Power system is provided on an isolated 
transformer. This is necessary to avoid unwanted hum and noise that can be introduced by lighting, 
mechanical equipment, and diffe ring ground planes. All power for audiovisual equipment throughout 
the facility should be tied to the same isolated transformer. 
Junction Box Locations 
The locations and types of all junction boxes for a udio-video equipment will be illustrated on facility 
plan view drawings in AutoCAD format. 
Cable Requirements The cable types and quantities required at each junc tion box location will be clearly indicated in order 
to determine conduit sizes and routing. 
Equipment Room Layout 
The locations and sizes of all racks and distributi on boxes in the audiovisual equipment rooms will be 
drawn to scale on facility plan view drawings. 
Power Requirements 
Electrical requirements will be specified for the comple te audiovisual system in the form of peak and 
average current and power draw. The Owner’s electri cal engineer will be able to size the transformer 
and design the electrical panel from this information. 
Heat Load Data 
The approximate BTU generation of audiovisual equipment within the equipment room will be 
estimated for the client’s HVAC engineer.

PHASE III. C ONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS 
At this point, the design documents are now complete  and build drawings are created to include cable 
numbers and other necessary details to allow the tec hnicians in the field to build a complete, functioning 
system. The client will have in its possession all the submittals from this design contract in the form of 
relevant construction documents, a detailed Scope of Work and an equipment list with final pricing. 
Construction Administration 
Once the construction phase begins, Avitecture’s Project Manager will collaborate with necessary 
trades to insure that all of our efforts of the past months do not go to waste. The Project Manager will 
insure that the infrastructure requirements de tailed on the audiovisual design documents are 
understood in installed as indicated. The Project ma nager will inspect the work and in the event of 
any issues, make suggestions for corrective actions. 
PHASE IV. INSTALLATION PHASE 
Within one day of receiving the notice to proceed w ith the installation, the necessary documentation is 
assembled into a “job jacket” and is distributed to  Avitecture’s installation team and the procurement 
department. This documentation includes the proposal  as it was submitted to the client, the purchase 
order, client design package including drawings a nd signoff forms. It is the responsibility of the 
Avitecture® Systems Consultant to prepare this documentation. 
A kick-off meeting is scheduled to discuss the project. Topics will include: 
Scope of Work 
Submittals  
Equipment delivery 
Room Priorities 
Building Access 
Load in Procedures 
Installation Schedule 
Change Order Procedure 
Roles and Responsibilities 
The Avitecture® Systems Consultant, Project Manager and System Designer will attend this 
meeting. At this point the Project Manager become s the main point of contact for the project.

Avitecture’s Project Manager will be responsible for tracking equipment delivery and adjusting the 
delivery or installation schedule accordingly. Th e Project Manager will also be responsible for 
communicating equipment issues with the client. 
Avitecture employs 30 Installation Technicians allowing us the ability to field multiple installation crews 
to meet project deadlines.  While equipment is on order, Avitecture’s designers will prepare build diagrams for each room based on 
the design drawings. Copies of the build drawings w ill be provided to the Rack Fabrication Team, Lead 
Technician and Control System Programmer. The Pr ogrammer will begin to write the control system 
program.  Once equipment has arrived, equipment racks for each area will be loaded with  equipment according the 
rack elevations in the build drawings, and all connec tions within the rack will be made. Equipment will be 
tested to the extent possible. The control system program will be tested and debugged.  
All displays will be set up and tested as well. Any e quipment that is defective can be replaced prior to 
delivery to the job site, thus minimizing on-site delays.   In preparation for delivery of equipment to the site, the installation team will begin non-equipment 
installation. This includes pre-wiring the site, in stalling and terminating all input/output plates, 
installation of floorboxes, installing equipment supports  where needed, and installation of speakers. This 
work can be performed while the bu ilding is still in the construction phase. The audiovisual installation 
will start after most of the construction work is complete in order to protect sensitive and costly optics 
and electronics that must be kept cl ean and free of dust during installation. 
Once equipment racks are built and the site is conf irmed to be in “broom-clean” condition (dust-free, 
painted and air conditioned) all equipment will be deliv ered to the site. We will require a secure storage 
area for equipment while work on site is in progress. Th is will allow us to be mo re efficient in our work, 
minimizing the installation time. We will also require  a signature from the client confirming delivery and 
acceptance of equipment.

University of Maryland - Stamp Student Union and Smith School of Business 
The University of Maryland, College Park is a public 
research university, the flagship campus of the 
University System of Maryland, and the original 
1862 land-grant institution in the State. It is one of only 62 members of the Association of American 
Universities, an organization composed of the 
leading research universities in the United States and Canada. Avitecture was selected to work with The 
University of Maryland for several projects including 
the Robert H. Smith School of Business and the Stamp Student Union. The Smith School of Business 
project tasked Avitecture to improve communications and provide flexible and scalable a udiovisual systems and upgrades of existing systems 
for Lecture Halls, Master Control Rooms, labs, and public spaces. The Stamp Student Union project 
required the addition of dynamic digital signage and al ert notification systems in this important student 
gathering area. 
Figure IV-I. Smith School of Business 
Avitecture provided the University of Maryland with a full design review of existing systems and suggested upgrades in 
the areas covered by this project. Solutions provided included 
plasma flat panel displays, project ors, audio systems, integrated 
control systems, and digital signage and alerting. In the Smith 
School, the integrated AV systems allow the user to send any 
source or information in their area to any plasma monitor throughout the installation area. All sources and destinations 
can be individually selected via a simple to use touchscreen 
custom programmed for the Univ ersity’s needs. For digital 
signage and alerting systems in  the Stamp Student Union, 
seven 42” flat screen monitors located around the building at 
each major entrance. The monitors are all connected to a 
system that provides up-to-date  information including a direct 
link to computerized scheduling software to display the daily events of the building. It also a llows for direct computer, video, 
and television feeds to allow for emergency notifications,

John and Anne Wilson Hall, Washington & Lee University, Music and Arts Facility 
Avitecture was first asked to design and 
then build a professional-quality digital audio recording studio and high 
performance sound reinforcement system 
for a new performing arts center at Washington & Lee University’s Wilson 
Hall. The center is to serve as a live 
performance venue for the university as well as a classroom environment for both 
performers and technical audio production 
students. 
A large stage area accommodates a wide range of produc tion requirements. Live mix consoles are located 
at floor level and in a control room with state-of-t he-art digital recording equipment. The stage has the 
capacity for up to 42 microphones. The system includes an overflow and monitoring system that allows 
individuals backstage, guests in the lobby and empl oyees in the ticket booth to view and monitor live 
performances.  
Figure IV-K. Wilson Hall 
Elsewhere around facility are a number of classroom s, containing basic AV presentation systems for 
teaching applications, several of which also have access to live performance feeds, for various production 
and recording exercises. This was a long-term project, with the design portion of the project in process for two years prior to the 
construction of the space. Near completion of th e initial design phase, personnel and changes at the 
University led to significant changes to the project as the project move d from a strictly performance space 
to include systems that would be used in a teachi ng environment. Avitecture worked closely with the 
client at this point to redefine design parameters  and develop plans based on the new requirements.  
Ultimately, Avitecture was able to successfully tr anslate the University’s vision of a premier live 
performance venue and learning center into reality.

This project underwent substantia l changes from its initial design. 
The recording system became completely digital, the portable 
cart/rack was eliminated, the digital snake was elimin ated and replaced with a conventional snake, the 
control room location was changed to be a record ing location, the microphone splitter was re-designed, 
one of the two subwoofers was eliminated, the wall plates were changed to accommodate the system 
design (and then specified to match a certain RAL color as to further blend into the room). Great effort 
was taken to insure that the syst em met all parties’ expectations.

In my capacity as Branch Manager, Commercial Division at Crestron Electronics, I realize and value 
the importance of true partnerships we share with our dealer channel partners. In our efforts to promote the value of Crestron’s products and services to the market—it’s vitally important to share a mutual confidence in the companies representing, selling, installing and programming Crestron equipment. 
I’ve personally experienced Avitecture first-rate presence within the federal, commercial and higher 
education markets. For years, Avitecture has maintained and exceeded the highest rated standards 
within the region. This includes all product training, installation, programming and after-the-installation services involving Crestron products. 
Additionally, Crestron puts a large emphasis on training our dealers to keep in step with Crestron’s 
cutting edge products, including DigitalMedia. Since Crestron introduced the DigitalMedia Certification Program, Avitecture continues to set the standard in training its technical staff. To date, Avitecture has 10 certified DMC-E (Engineering certification) employees on staff, as well as another 20 certified DMC-D (Designer certification).
