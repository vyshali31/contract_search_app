Use by Non-State of Maryland Government Entities 
County, municipal, and other non-S tate governments or government agencies within the State of 
Maryland may purchase from the Contractor goods or services covered by this Contract at the 
same prices chargeable to the State.  All such purchases by non-State of Maryland governments or 
government agencies: (1) shall cons titute Contracts between the Cont ractor and that government or

shall not be binding or enforceable against the St ate; and (4) may be subject to other terms and

Liquidated Damages  
(Note: The Liquidated Damages sectio n has been updated in its entirety.) 
 
*It is critical to the success of the State’s progra ms that the interpretation and translation services 
be maintained in accordance with the agreed upon sche dules.  It is also critical to the success of the 
State’s programs that the Contractor ope rates in an extremely reliable manner. 
 
It would be impracticable and extremely difficult to fix the actual damage sustained by the State in 
the event of delays in service on scheduled work and provision of services to the State and its 
citizens.  The State and the Contr actor(s), therefore, presume that in the event of any such delay, 
the amount of damage which will be sustained fr om a delay will be the amount set forth in the 
paragraphs below, and the Contract or agrees that in the event of any such delay, the Contractor 
shall pay such amount(s) as liquidated damages and not as a penalty.  The State, at its option for 
050B7800015 5 OVERVIEW OF THE CONTRACT’S SERVICES V.2_5/29/2008  amount due the State as liquidated damages, may deduct such from any money payable to the 
applicable Contractor or may bill the Contractor as a separate item. 
 
Reliability of the service of the Contractor(s) is  of the essence.  Downtime on any part of the 
Contracted interpretation and translation services must be minimized by prompt response and 
corrective action within the time specified belo w for the detection of a problem by either the 
Contract Administrator or the Cont ractor.  If the Contractor fails to provide the requested services 
within the time specified below, then the Stat e may assess liquidated damages as provided below 
in the following amounts:  
A. For Core Languages for Telephonic Language Inte rpretation:  The Primary Contractor’s 
inability to provide Telephone In terpretation services for Core Languages within forty-five 
(45) minutes of the State’s sending of the request will result in the assessment of liquidated damages.  The amount of the liquidated da mages will be the difference between the 
Primary Contractor’s approved price rate for Telephonic Language Interpretation and the 
price rate incurred by the Requesting Agency  or Requesting Entity to place the call(s) 
through the Secondary Contractor at the Second ary Contractor’s approv ed price rate (Ref. 
Section 2.3.4.7), or another Telephonic Language Interpreting company (at that company’s one-time use rates) for the total price of the call(s). 
 
 B1. For Core Languages for Onsite Language Interpretation:  For Core Languages, a Primary 
Contractor who has received greater than fort y-eight hours (48) and less than ninety-six 
hours (96) advanced notice of the State’s request and who fails to provide written 
confirmation of the assigned Routine On-Site Interpreter via e-mail or facsimile to the 
Requesting Agency or Requesting Entity Repres entative within twenty-four (24) hours of 
the assignment, will be assessed liquidated damages unless there is prior written confirmation from the Contract Administrator that liquidated damages do not apply.   The 
amount of the liquidated damages will be the difference between the Primary Contractor’s 
approved price rate for Routine On-Site inte rpretation and the Seco ndary Contractor’s 
approved price rate for Exped ited On-Site interpretation for the total price of the work 
order.  Liquidated damages do not apply to  the Primary Contractor if the Secondary 
Contractor is also unable to provide written confirmation of  an assigned Routine On-Site 
Interpreter. 
 
B2.   For Core Languages for Onsite Language Interpretation:  For Core Languages, a Primary 
Contractor who has received a minimum of nine ty-six hours (96) advanced notification of 
the State’s request and who fails to provide written confirmation of the assigned Routine On-Site Interpreter via e-mail or facsimile to the Requesting Agency or Requesting Entity Representative within forty-eight (48) hours of the assignment, will be assessed liquidated damages unless there is prior written confirma tion from the Contract Administrator that 
liquidated damages do not apply.   If the Secondary Contractor is the Contractor to provide 
confirmation of an assigned interpreter when contacted by the Primary Contractor (see 
Section 2.3.4), the amount of the liquidated damages will be the difference between the 
Primary Contractor’s approved price rate for Routine On-Site interpretation and the 
Secondary Contractor’s approved price rate for E xpedited On-Site interpretation for the 
total price of the work order.  Liquidated dama ges do not apply to the Primary Contractor if 
the Secondary Contractor is also unable to provide written confirmation of an assigned 
Routine On-Site Interpreter. 
050B7800015 6 OVERVIEW OF THE CONTRACT’S SERVICES V.2_5/29/2008   
C. For Core Languages for Written Document La nguage Translation:  A Primary Contractor 
who fails to provide Written Document Language Translation services for Core Languages 
within one (1) day for up to ten (10) pages of  Expedited requests and within one (1) week 
for up to twenty (20) pages of Routine requests of the State’s request, will be assessed liquidated damages.   The amount of the liqui dated damages will be the difference between 
the Primary Contractor’s approved rate fo r Written Document Language Translation and 
the rate incurred by the Requesting Agency or Requesting Entity to obtain the services through the Secondary Contractor at the Secondary Contractor’s approved rate (Ref. Section 2.4.8), or another written document tr anslation company (at that company’s one-
time use rates) for the total price of that work request. 
 
D. The Contractor(s) will not be assessed liqui dated damages when the delay arises out of 
causes beyond the control and without the fau lt or negligence of th e Contractor(s) as 
provided in section 19 (Delays and Extens ions of Time) of the Contract, if the 
Contractor(s) timely notifies the State of su ch circumstances in writing and the State 
determines the event was beyond the control and without fault or negligence of the 
Contractor(s).  This liquidated damages compensation will be for dela y-related costs only.  
The Contractor(s) will remain liable for other non-delay costs actually incurred by the State 
such as, by way of example only, excess procurement costs in the event the contract is terminated for cause and must be re-com peted by the State or awarded to another 
Contractor(s). 
 
E. Liquidated damages will not apply in any ci rcumstance involving a request to provide an 
interpreter with a specific, recognized certification.  *

2.5.1.1 Telephonic language interpretation service will be billed in 1/10th of a minute 
increments after the first minute, duri ng both Standard Hours and Non-Standard 
Hours. 
 
2.5.1.2 No travel time or mileage will be paid for statewide telephone interpretation 
service. 
 
2.5.1.3 For conference call billing purposes, the cont ractor may only bill for the actual time 
an interpreter participates in a call.  Th e time required to set-up the conference call 
prior to the interpreter joining the call an d any continuation of the conference call 
once the interpreter has dropped off, will not  be chargeable time.  The contractor 
may not terminate the conference call at any time before all parties to the call have dropped off, regardless of whether the se rvices of the interpreter are no longer 
needed.  (i.e. the Contractor must mainta in the conference call connection as long as 
at least 2 parties are still connected.) 
 
2.5.1.4 For all requests over 5 conference call participants, Offerors may charge an additional per participant, per minute rate  as specified within Attachment E, 
Financial Proposal Form - Tele phonic Interpretation Services. 
 
2.5.2 Service Category II: 
2.5.2.1 Routine On-site language interpretation se rvice, after the first two (2) hours, will 
be billed in 1/10th of an hour increments duri ng both Standard Hours and Non-
Standard Hours at the respective standard and non-standard rates from 
Attachment E – Financial Proposal Form. 
2.5.2.2 Expedited On-site language interpretati on service, after the first two (2) hours, 
will be billed in 1/10th of an hour increments during both Standard Hours and 
Non-Standard Hours at the respective standard and non-standard rates from 
Attachment E – Financial Proposal Form. 
050B7800015 20 OVERVIEW OF THE CONTRACT’S SERVICES V.2_5/29/2008  2.5.2.3 Critical On-Site language inte rpretation service, after the first two (2) hours, will 
be billed in 1/10th of an hour increments duri ng both Standard Hours and Non-
Standard Hours at the respective standard and non-standard rates from 
Attachment E – Financial Proposal Form. 
2.5.2.4 Any charges for mileage over thirty (30) miles, from a Base of Operations, one 
way, will be reimbursed in accordance with State travel regulations. 
2.5.2.5 Travel: 
2.5.2.5.1 Travel time will be paid for statew ide On-site interpretation service as 
described in 2.5.2.5.2.  
2.5.2.5.2 A. Whenever there is a request fo r on-site interpreter services any 
language or dialect,, the Contractor  may bill for travel time if an 
interpreter must travel more than 30 miles one way from his/her base of 
operations to the destination of the on-site translation.  For travel in 
excess of 30 miles the contractor may bill in 1/10th of an hour 
increments, at the rate of 1 minute of time for each ½ mile traveled.   
B Travel time will not be paid on an actual elapsed time basis.  It would 
be too difficult to verify actual trav el time since there will be great 
variability due to the time of day (rush hour versus non-rush hour) or level of congestion encountered.  Travel distance from an interpreter’s base of operations to the on-site interpretation destination shall be calculated and verified using the mapping distance listed on Mapquest.com.  If a Mapquest.com distance calculation is not available, the bill shall contain the distance as reported by the interpreter.  
Approval of this distance is subj ect to verificati on by the Requesting 
Agency or Requesting Entity. 
C  For example, if as identified by Mapquest.com, an assignment is 
located 52 miles from an interpreter’s  base of operations  the contractor 
may bill for the 22 miles beyond the 30 mile limit.  At a rate of 1 
minute of travel time per half mi le the billing would amount to 44 
minutes of billable time.  Since 44 minutes rounds to 8/10th of an hour, 
the contractor can bill for 8/10th of its hourly rate for travel in each 
direction, or a total of 1.6 hours. 
D. When more than one interpreter is available for an assignment,: 
1) The Contractor shall assign an in terpreter for whom travel time is 
not billable (i.e. one within 30 mile s of an onsite location) over one 
for which travel time will be billable, unless (a) a specific interpreter is requested by the Requesting Agency or Requesting 
Entity, or (b) The Contractor determ ines that a travel-time-billable 
interpreter is better qualified to provide on-site interpretation services for the requested language. 
2) If all available interpreters will be travel-time eligible, the Contractor shall assign a travel- time-billable interpreter that is 
closest to the destination of th e on-site transla tion, unless (a) a 
050B7800015 21 OVERVIEW OF THE CONTRACT’S SERVICES V.2_5/29/2008  specific interpreter is requested by the Requesting Agency or 
Requesting Entity, or (b) The Contra ctor determines that a travel-
time-billable interpreter is better qualified to provide on-site interpretation services for the requested language. 
3) In any instance where a travel -time-billable interpreter is sent 
over a non-travel-time-bill able interpreter or a more distant travel-
time-billable interpreter is sent over a closer one, the Contractor shall provide written documentati on to the Requesting Agency or 
Requesting Entity explaining why th e travel-time-billable or more 
distant travel-time-billable interpreter was chosen. If the Contractor fails to provide the justification for using an interpreter for which travel or additional travel, as applicable, is charged or if the Requesting Agency or Requesting Entity Representative determines the rationale for its usage is not sufficient, travel time charges or the more distant charges, as applicable, will not be paid.  
 
2.5.2.6 When more than one interpreter is avai lable for an assignment, the Contractor 
shall assign an interpreter for whom travel is not billable (i.e. one within 20 miles 
of on-site location) over one for which trav el will be billable, unless (a) a specific 
interpreter is requested by the Requesting Agency or Re questing Entity or (b) the 
Contractor determines that a travel-bill able interpreter is better qualified to 
provide on-site interpretati on services for the requeste d language.  The Contractor 
shall provide written documentation to  the Requesting Agency or Requesting 
Entity explaining why the travel -billable interpreter was chosen.  If the Contractor 
fails to provide the justification for using an interpreter for which travel is charged or if the Requesting Agency or Requesting Entity Representative determines the 
rationale for its usage is not sufficient, travel charges will not be paid. 
2.5.2.7     (A) At the time of assignment, th e Contractor will be notified whether the 
assignment is for a specific activity or an id entified timeframe (i.e. from 9 a.m. to 
12 p.m.).  If the assignment is for a speci fic activity, the billing as described in 
2.5.2.1, 2.2 or 2.3, as appropriate shall appl y.  If the assignment is for an 
identified timeframe that is greater than  two (2) hours, the billing will proceed at 
1/10th of an hour increments for the entire duration in ex cess of two hours, less a 
reasonable meal period (i.e. 30, 40 or 60 minutes).  For a defined timeframe 
assignment, the Requesting Agency or Requesting Entity reserves the right to 
request the availability of an on-site interpreter for multiple assignments during 
this timeframe provided all assignme nts are within the same location ; i.e. 
identified timeframe will not involve multiple two (2) hour minimum billable 
periods.  [For example, an identified timeframe (court hearing assignment) may 
be from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and it is expect ed that four (4) sepa rate hearings will 
occur during this period, and that ther e will be a 30 minute lunch period, the 
billing will be for 5.5 hours, (6 sche duled hours less a 30 minute lunch period), 
not for 2 hours per hearing, or 8 hours.  Moreover, if the last hearing ran until 
3:20 p.m., the billing would be for 6 hours and 20 minutes, less a 30 minute lunch period, or 5 hours and 50 minutes.  Or stat ed another way, the billing for On-Site 
interpreters will be for th e duration of the identified timeframe, the initial 2 hour 
050B7800015 22 OVERVIEW OF THE CONTRACT’S SERVICES V.2_5/29/2008  period from 9-11 a.m. and the duration of time after 11:00 a.m. in 1/10th of an 
hour increments, less a lunch period.  In this section A the term “identified 
timeframe” shall be replaced with “approximate timeframe”. 
2.5.2.7   (B) If a requesting ag ency or entity requests interpreter services for a 
definite period of time rather than an approximate timeframe, such as an  8 
am to 4 pm shift to accompany a specific juvenile in a juvenile facility, the Contractor may bill for the full defined pe riod of time, even if the interpreter 
is dismissed before the end of that time period. 
2.5.2.8 For a request for Routine or Expedited On-Site interpretation that is cancelled 
with less than  twenty-four (24) hours notice, the Requesting Agency or 
Requesting Entity shall be required to pay the Contractor the two (2) hour minimum billable time. 
2.5.2.9 For any Expedited request with less th an 24 hours notice or for any Critical 
requests that are cancelled, the Requesting Agency or Requesting Entity shall be 
required to pay the Contractor the two (2) hour minimum billable time. 
2.5.2.10 If the contractor is requested to provide  an on-site interpreter with a specific, 
commonly recognized professional certificati on, a flat percentage surcharge, not 
to exceed 20%  may be added to the Cont ractor’s otherwise applicable rate(s). 
2.5.2.11 In addition to the pricing required on th e financial proposal form (Attachment E), 
in accordance with section 3.4.5.2.8 (Discounted Pric ing) the Contractor may 
identify circumstances when it will disc ount its Attachment E onsite prices.  To 
the extent that the Contr actor provides such additiona l pricing discounts, it must 
ensure that its invoicing properly reflect s all circumstances when such discounts 
are to apply. 
 
2.5.3 Service Category III: 
2.5.3.1 Written document language translation servi ce will be billed at the per word rate 
from Attachment E – Financial Proposal Form. 
2.5.3.2 No travel time or mileage will be paid for statewide written document 
interpretation service. 
2.5.3.3 In addition to the pricing required on th e financial proposal form (Attachment E), 
in accordance with section 3.4.5.3.8 the C ontractor may identify circumstances 
when  it will discount its Attachment E written document prices, or waive the per word price for repetitive text.  To the ex tent that the Contractor provides such 
repetitive text pricing discounts or billing waiver, it must ensure that its invoicing 
properly reflects all circumstances when such discounts or waivers are to apply. 
 
2.5.4 For Service Categories I and II: 
2.5.4.1 If services are provided during both St andard Hours and Non-Standard Hours, 
payment will be made for the actual time worked in each time period in 
accordance with the provisions of Sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2 above, at the appropriate standard hour or non- standard hour rate increment. 
 
050B7800015 23 OVERVIEW OF THE CONTRACT’S SERVICES V.2_5/29/2008  2.5.5 For ALL Service Categories:

fee for the non-usage of services.

Contractor for scheduled quarterly mee tings or for any meetings relating to

oneself in the spoken or written English language.
