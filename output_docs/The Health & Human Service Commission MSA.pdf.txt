7.01 Agreement of the Parties
The Parties agree that the interests of fairness, efficiency, a nd good business practices are best served when 
the Parties employ all reasonable and informal means to resolve  any dispute under the Contract before 
resorting to formal dispute resolution processes otherwise prov ided in the Contract.  The Parties will use 
all reasonable and informal means of resolving disputes prior t o invoking a remedy provided elsewhere in 
the Contract, unless HHSC immediately terminates the Contract i n accordance with the terms and 
conditions of the Contract.
Any dispute, that in the judgment of any Party to the Agreement , may materially affect the performance of 
any Party will be reduced to writing and delivered to the other  Party within 10 business days after the 
dispute arises.  The Parties must then negotiate in good faith and use every reasonable effort to resolve the 
dispute at the managerial or executive levels prior to initiati ng formal proceedings pursuant to the UTC and 
Texas Government Code ¬ß2260, unless a Party has reasonably dete rmined that a negotiated resolution is
not possible and has so notified the other Party.  The resoluti on of any dispute disposed of by agreement 
between the Parties will be reduced to writing and delivered to  all Parties within 10 business days of such 
resolution.
7.02 Operational Remedies
The remedies described in this section may be used or pursued b y HHSC in the context of the routine 
operation of the Contract and are directed to Contractor's time ly and responsive performance of the Work 
as well as the creation of a flexible and responsive relationsh ip between the Parties.  Contractor agrees that 
HHSC may pursue operational remedies for Items of Noncompliance  with the Contract.  At any time, and 
at its sole discretion, HHSC may impose or pursue one or more s aid remedies for each Item of 
Noncompliance.  HHSC will determine operational remedies on a c ase-by-case basis which include, but 
are not, limited to:
(a) Requesting a detailed Corrective Action Plan, subject to HHS C approval, to correct and resolve a 
deficiency or breach of the Contract;
(b) Require additional or differe nt corrective action(s) of HHSC' s choice;
(c) Suspension of all or part of the Contract or Work;
(d) Prohibit Contractor from incurring additional obligations un der the Contract;
(e) Issue Notice to stop Work Orders;
(f) Assessment of liquidated damages as provided in the Contract ;
(g) Accelerated or additional monitoring;
(h) Withholding of payments; and
(i) Additional and more detailed programmatic and financial repo rting.
HHSC's pursuit or non-pursuit of an operational remedy does not constitute a waiver of any other remedy 
that HHSC may have at law or equ ity; excuse Contractor's prior substandard performance, relieve 
Contractor of its duty to comply with performance standards, or   prohibit HHSC from assessing additional 
operational remedies or pursuing other appropriate remedies for continued substandard performance.
HHSC will provide notice to Contractor of the imposition of an operational remedy in accordance with this 
section, with the exception of accelerated monitoring, which ma y be unannounced.  HHSC may require 
Contractor to file a written response as part of the operationa l remedy approach.  

Page 7 of 127.03 Equitable Remedies
Contractor acknowledges that if, Contractor breaches, attempts,  or threatens to breach, any obligation under 
the Contract, the State will be irreparably harmed.  In such a circumstance, the State may proceed directly 
to court notwithstanding any other provision of the Contract.  If a court of competent jurisdiction finds that 
Contractor breached, attempted, or threatened to breach any suc h obligations, Contractor will not oppose 
the entry of an order compelling performance by Contractor and restraining it from any further breaches, 
attempts, or threats of breach without a further finding of irreparable injury or other conditions to injunctive 
relief.
7.04 Continuing Duty to Perform
Neither the occurrence of an event constituting an alleged brea ch of contract, the pending status of any 
claim for breach of contract, nor the application of an operational remedy, is grounds for the suspension of performance, in whole or in part, by Contractor of the Work or any duty or obligation with respect to the 
Contract.
Article VIII. Damages
8.01 Availability and Assessment
HHSC will be entitled to actual, direct, indirect, incidental, special, and consequential damages resulting

Contract are difficult or impossible to determine with precise a ccuracy.  Therefore, if provided in the 
Contract, liquidated damages may be assessed against Contractor  for failure to meet any aspect of the Work 
or responsibilities of the Contractor.  HHSC may elect to colle ct liquidated damages:
(a) Through direct assessment and demand for payment to Contract or; or
(b) By deducting the amounts assessed as liquidated damages agai nst payments owed to Contractor for
