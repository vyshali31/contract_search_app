such payment to the Authority, the obligations of the Concessionaire in respect of
such works shall be deemed to have been fulfilled. F or the avoidance of doubt, it is

a reduction in the net after-tax return of the Concessionaire, the Parties shall meet,
as soon as reasonably practical, and agree on a full or partial waiver of the
aforesaid payment of 80% (eighty per cent) so as to place the Concessionaire in the
same financial position as it would have enjoyed had there been no reduction in
